# Sum of two numbers returned from a function

```
Angular uses a similar device to Vue in order to ease up code writing.  However, instead of each section (HTML, Javascript, CSS) residing in the same component file, Angular uses separate files.

In Angular, which is Typescript only, not Javascript, there are four required files per component:
*.component.css -- CSS
*.component.html -- HTML and Angular bindings
*.component.ts -- Typescript functionality
*.module.ts -- imports and component setups

Each component resides in its own folder.

For this simple app, I only needed one component.
