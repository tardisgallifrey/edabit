# Bitwise uses in C

<p>I started this challenge off incorrectly</p>
<p>I believed that we were required to write the functions from scratch.  Therefore, I needed to convert integers to binary representation.  After a day of work, I did successfully create a set of functions that allows one to convert integers to binary in C.</p>
<p>However, that's not what was called for.  So, I leave my work here just for knowledge sake</p>
