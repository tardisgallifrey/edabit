# Coding practice
### done in the following methods:
C<br/>
C++<br/>
Python<br/>
Rust<br/>
Java<br/>
Kotlin<br/>
Javascript<br/>
Angular<br/>
React<br/>
Vue<br/>

<p>I've been struggling to find a good way to practice and improve my coding lately.  I hit upon using [Edabit](https://edabit.com) as a means of responding to challenge ideas. Instead of coding them all online (which also would cost money), I am creating a project of projects.</p>

<p>In addition, because I know how to do it most days, I am also requiring myself to actually write programs, useable programs instead of just tidbits that work.</p>
